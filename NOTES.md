# Edge.js Browser Target — NOTES

Running log of the browser port: what works, what's known-broken, and
what's deliberately deferred.  See [ARCHIVE.md](./ARCHIVE.md) for the
full historical trail of how each piece got built and the bugs hit
along the way (~2000 lines, newest-first).

## Project orientation

**Goal**: run unmodified edge.js (a Node-compatible runtime) inside a
browser via WebAssembly.  StackBlitz-grade Node compat in the browser.

**Architecture**: `edgejs.wasm` (built with `EDGE_NAPI_PROVIDER=imports`)
expects the host to provide three things:

- **WASI syscalls** — `browser-target/src/wasi-shim.ts`
- **Standard N-API** — `@emnapi/core` + our overrides
- **napi/v8 adapter (unofficial_napi_*)** — `browser-target/src/napi-host/`

Plus a SharedArrayBuffer-backed `WebAssembly.Memory`, a Service Worker
for HTTP bridging, and a FileSystem facade.

**Iteration loop**:
- **Node harness** (`browser-target/scripts/node-harness.mjs`): ~3s,
  same code paths as the browser, just `fs.readFileSync` instead of
  sync XHR.  Required for fast crypto/napi work.
- **Browser** (`vite dev` on `:5180`): ~15s, full end-to-end including
  Service Worker bridge.

## Current capability

| Surface | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Boot, console.log to stdout | ✅ | `_start` runs ~130-200ms |
| `process.exit(N)` | ✅ | clean teardown |
| `setTimeout` / `setInterval` | ✅ | via `poll_oneoff` Atomics.wait |
| `http.createServer` + fetch roundtrip | ✅ | Service Worker bridge, page relay |
| `fs.readFileSync` on `/node-lib/**` + `/node/deps/**` | ✅ | bundled adapter via sync XHR |
| `fs.writeFileSync` to userland paths | ✅ | in-memory only (no persistence yet) |
| `crypto.createHash().update().digest('hex')` | ✅ | sha256 verified correct |
| `crypto.randomBytes(N).toString('hex')` | ✅ | real entropy via `/dev/urandom` |
| `crypto.randomUUID()` | ✅ | real UUID v4 |
| `require('node:builtin')` (most) | ✅ | from compiled-in catalog |
| Module-source overrides | ✅ | universal — bootstrap + lazy-required builtins |
| Test harness over `tests/js/*` | ✅ | `scripts/test-runner.mjs`, 8/8 passing, ~300ms/test |
| `import` (ESM) | ❌ | `module_wrap_*` are stubs |
| `tls.createSecureContext` / `https.createServer` + listen | ✅ | OpenSSL bundled; cert/key parsed; `listen()` callback fires |
| HTTPS server through SW bridge | ✅ | `inbound-https-via-sw` policy (default in browser); SW is the TLS endpoint, wasm sees pre-parsed HTTP |
| Outbound `http.request` / `https.request` | ❌ → throws cleanly | `outbound-throw` policy is the Node-honest default; opt-in shortcuts are pending policy additions |
| **Policies framework** (deployment DI) | ✅ | `browser-target/src/policies/*.ts`; array of strategies, last-wins composition |
| OPFS persistence (real disk) | ❌ | in-memory only |
| `worker_threads` | ❌ | not started |
| `child_process` | ❌ | needs subprocess model |
| Concurrent HTTP | ⚠️  | single-flight per-SW |

**Boot cost**: ~130-200ms `_start` time + ~50ms wasm compile (after first run cached).

**Auto-prepend**: every user `-e` script gets the active policies'
`userScriptPrelude` concatenated in front of it.  At minimum that's
`try{Buffer.poolSize=0}catch{};` (from `buffer-pool-disable`) which is
required for crypto correctness — edge's Buffer pool slicing doesn't
compose with our wasm-backed ArrayBuffer model.  Browser worker adds
the `outbound-throw` prelude (patches `http.request`/`https.request`
to throw `ERR_BROWSER_NO_OUTBOUND`).  See `policies/index.ts` for the
full bundle and ARCHIVE.md "Crypto FULL surface working" for the
Buffer.poolSize backstory.

## Active tech-debt catalog

Inline `#!~debt` markers point here.  Each is a deliberate shortcut with a
specific remediation path.  Counts as of writing: **52 markers** across the
browser-target tree.

### Boot-blocking / correctness

- `crude-circuit-breaker` — `CALL_LIMIT = 20000` in worker.ts.  Real fix:
  watchdog timer on progress, not call count.
- `fake-fs-fallback` — `path_filestat_get` returns success for paths the
  FS doesn't recognize (kept to avoid breaking libc cwd probes).
- `dynCall-before-table-ready` — `unofficial_napi_create_env` passes
  silent no-op dispatchers for makeDynCall callbacks; emnapi finalizers
  at process exit dispatch through these and silently skip.  Long-term
  fix is to wire `__indirect_function_table` from the bound instance.
- ~~`sab-ab-body-read`~~ **RESOLVED 2026-05-21** — was: edge's fetch
  impl + Response.body / .text() / .arrayBuffer() threw
  `Method get ArrayBuffer.prototype.byteLength called on incompatible
  receiver #<SharedArrayBuffer>`.  Two layered causes; both fixed.
  Resolution:
  - **Layer 1**: `internalBinding('task_queue').enqueueMicrotask` infinite-recurses.
    Edge's `TaskQueueEnqueueMicrotask` (`src/edge_task_queue.cc:42`) tries
    `unofficial_napi_enqueue_microtask` first; the V8 impl
    (`napi/v8/src/unofficial_napi.cc:2198`) requires `env->isolate`, which
    is null under emnapi → returns `napi_invalid_arg`.  C++ then falls
    back to calling `globalThis.queueMicrotask` via napi — which resolves
    to **lib's wrapper** (`task_queues.js:158`) that calls
    `enqueueMicrotask` (this binding) again.  Infinite synchronous recursion.
    Fixed by **`task-queue-enqueue-fix` policy** (in minimalPolicies):
    `{ pre }` patch on `internal/process/task_queues.js` rebinds
    `internalBinding('task_queue').enqueueMicrotask` to call the **host's
    native** `queueMicrotask` directly — bypassing edge's broken fallback.
  - **Layer 2** (only visible after Layer 1 fix): edge's vendored
    `internal/webstreams/readablestream.js` and `internal/crypto/*` use
    strict V8 primordials `ArrayBufferPrototypeGet{ByteLength,Detached}`,
    `Slice`, `Transfer` on buffers that — post our wasm-aliasing — are
    SharedArrayBuffer instances.  Fixed by **`buffer-wasm-aliased`
    policy's `PRIMORDIALS_PRE_PATCH`**: `{ pre }` patch on
    `internal/per_context/primordials.js` replaces those AB prototype
    methods with polymorphic versions that dispatch to SAB equivalents
    when the receiver is a SAB (transfer returns the SAB itself, since
    SAB can't be detached).  Primordials snapshot via `uncurryThis(get)`
    captures our polymorphic versions.
  - Regression: `tests/js/response-body-consume.js`.

- `task-queue-fallback-recursion` — historical: discovered while fixing
  `sab-ab-body-read`.  Edge's C++ `TaskQueueEnqueueMicrotask` calls
  `globalThis.queueMicrotask` as a fallback when its preferred path
  fails — but globalThis.queueMicrotask resolves to lib's wrapper that
  uses this very binding.  Synchronous infinite recursion.  Surfaced as
  `Maximum call stack size exceeded` on any code path heavy in
  microtasks (streams, fetch bodies, promise chains).  Fixed by
  `task-queue-enqueue-fix` policy.  Most existing tests didn't hit it
  because they didn't exercise queueMicrotask aggressively.
  - The primordials patch source lives in `buffer-wasm-aliased.ts` as
    `PRIMORDIALS_PRE_PATCH` but is NOT applied (commented out via `void`)
    because the partial fix is worse than the original throw (silent
    max-stack vs. catchable TypeError).
  - Path forward: either (a) replace edge's bundled fetch/Response with
    a custom shim that doesn't go through the SAB-incompatible
    primordial path, or (b) deep-dive the stream pull machinery to
    understand why our `transfer` patches cause recursion.  Logged as
    `#!~debt buffer-wasm-aliased-sab-stream-recursion`.
- `lazy-load-from-microtask` — `BuiltinModule.compileForInternalLoader`
  invoked from a microtask continuation (post-await) returns
  non-function for lazy builtins (`internal/util/colors`,
  `internal/util/inspect`, `tty`, etc).  Visible as `TypeError: fn is
  not a function` from realm.js:401 when `console.log` is first used
  inside a callback.  Workaround in outbound-fetch-tunnel: prelude
  primes the lazy paths by silently calling `console.log('','')`
  with swapped-out write functions.  Root cause unknown — likely
  related to napi state lifetime across microtask boundaries.
- `microtasks-starved-by-pending-timer` — when a `setTimeout(..., N)`
  is pending, edge's wasm event loop blocks ALL microtasks until the
  timer fires.  Async/await + setTimeout in the same test = test
  always sees the timer first.  Test code avoids setTimeout watchdogs
  for now; relies on the test-runner's 30s subprocess timeout for
  genuine hangs.  Root cause unknown — likely in our poll_oneoff
  implementation choosing to wait on timers before draining JS tasks.
- ~~`buffer-write-jsab-stale`~~ **RESOLVED 2026-05-21** — was: emnapi's
  `napi_create_external_arraybuffer` (used by edge's
  `createUnsafeArrayBuffer`) created a JS-heap AB with a sync-table
  mapping to a wasm pointer; C++ write bindings touched wasm only,
  JS-side stayed stale until a subsequent napi-going op triggered
  resync.  Indexed access (`buf[i]`) after a write returned stale
  bytes.  Fix: `buffer-wasm-aliased` policy (in minimalPolicies)
  combining (a) napi-host override of
  `napi_create_external_arraybuffer` that registers the handle as a
  `Uint8Array` view over `wasmMemory.buffer` directly, and (b) a
  surgical `{ post }` patch on `internal/buffer.js` that rewrites
  `createUnsafeBuffer` to construct `FastBuffer` via the
  `(buffer, byteOffset, byteLength)` form (avoiding the
  `new Uint8Array(TA)` copy).  Side-effects: every Buffer's
  `.buffer === wasmMemory.buffer` and `.byteOffset === wasm_ptr`;
  JS-side `buf[i]` and C++ pointer touch the same byte; test suite
  is ~3× faster overall because emnapi's redundant syncMemory copies
  are bypassed.  Side-fix in same policy: `markAsUntransferable` now
  swallows non-extensible-target errors (SAB can't take a Symbol prop;
  it's already effectively untransferable).  Regression test:
  tests/js/buffer-from-string.js.
  Older `buffer-write-sync` policy retained in the registry as an
  alternative (wraps Buffer write entry points to trigger syncs) —
  useful for isolating future regressions to the napi-host layer vs
  somewhere else.  Not in defaults anymore.
- `buffer-wasm-aliased-policy-required` — the *structural* properties
  the new model relies on (Buffer.buffer is the SAB; byteOffset is
  the wasm ptr; .length is per-buffer) are now load-bearing.  Any
  user code that assumes `buf.buffer instanceof ArrayBuffer`
  (vs SharedArrayBuffer), assumes `buf.buffer.byteLength === buf.length`,
  or attempts to define non-Symbol properties on `buf.buffer` will
  break.  Default browser/harness deployments are safe; only handcrafted
  intros into the ArrayBuffer of a Buffer would notice the change.

### Sockets / HTTP

- `single-listener` — one TCP listener at a time
- `single-flight` — one inflight HTTP request per Service Worker
- `no-keep-alive` — `Connection: close` forced in request synthesizer
- `no-chunked-encoding` — auto-flush requires `Content-Length`
- `no-outbound` — `sock_connect` returns ENOSYS (no http client → external)
- `no-socketpair` — `child_process` etc. won't work
- `no-sendfile` — `sock_send_file` returns ENOSYS
- `sw-sab-relay` — workaround for Chrome SAB/postMessage→SW incompat
- `no-blocking-pipe` — `fd_pipe` reader-before-writer returns EAGAIN
- `wake-slot-collisions` — 255 conn slots max
- `fake-local-addr`, `fake-peer` — addr structs don't reflect real binding
- `no-ipv6` — sock_bind parses IPv4 only

### Filesystem

- `opfs-not-yet-persistent` — in-memory only; tab reload loses state
- `opfs-flat-store` — readdir does prefix scan, no real dir structure
- `sync-xhr-network-blocking` — bundled adapter blocks worker on cold-cache fetch
- `no-write-support` — bundled adapter is read-only
- `no-readdir` — bundled adapter has no listing endpoint
- `naïve-stat-via-fetch` — stat via HEAD, no mtime/ctime

### napi / Buffer

- `namespace-default-fallbacks` — `imports-generated.ts` falls through to
  per-namespace defaults (napi=0, wasi=52).  "Implemented" means "callable
  with right arity," not "semantically correct."
- `unverified-one-time-anomaly` in `mem-snapshot.ts` — diagnostic artifact
- Multiple `#!~debt` in `unofficial.ts` — most no-op stubs writing sensible
  defaults to out-params, ported from `napi/v8/src/*.cc`.  Promote when a
  workload lights them up.

## Active followups (in priority order)

### Universal module overrides via napi binding hook — DONE (2026-05-21)

Two hooks, covering both load paths edge uses:

1. **Bootstrap modules** → intercepted in
   `unofficial_napi_contextify_compile_function`
   (`browser-target/src/napi-host/unofficial.ts`).  Catches the ~11
   modules edge compiles through this entry: `per_context/*`,
   `bootstrap/realm`, `bootstrap/node`, `web/exposed-*`, `switches/*`,
   `main/eval_string`, and the `[eval]-wrapper` for user scripts.

2. **Lazy-required builtins** (`inspector`, `url`, `crypto`, `events`,
   etc.) → intercepted in a wrapper around emnapi's `napi_run_script`
   (`browser-target/src/napi-host/index.ts`).  Edge loads these via
   `EvaluateJsModule` (`src/edge_module_loader.cc:4495`), which wraps
   the source as
   `(function(exports, require, module, process, internalBinding, primordials) {\n<source>\n})\n//# sourceURL=node:<id>`
   and runs it via `napi_run_script`.  Our hook parses the sourceURL,
   looks up the id in the override map, and rewrites the inner body
   before passing the script to emnapi.

Surface: `NapiHostOptions.builtinOverrides: Record<string, string | null
| undefined>`.  Node harness exposes `--override <id>:<value>` where
value is a literal path (file contents loaded), a string `null` (empty
stub `module.exports = {}`), or anything else (used as source).

**Verified end-to-end**:
- `--override inspector:null` → `require('inspector')` returns `{}`
  (no `ERR_INSPECTOR_NOT_AVAILABLE` throw).
- `--override "inspector:module.exports = { custom: true, ping: () => 'pong' };"`
  → custom exports surface through the user-visible require.

### ESM support (`module_wrap_*`)

The 18 `module_wrap_*` impls are stubs that return placeholder handles.
Real Node code using `import` syntax fails at link/evaluate.  Probably
need Asyncify to bridge browser's async `import()` to sync wasm.
600-1500 LOC chunk.

### Outbound HTTP/HTTPS

Default browser policy stack is Node-honest: outbound `http.request` /
`https.request` throw `ERR_BROWSER_NO_OUTBOUND`.  Two shortcut policies
exist as Policy slots in the framework:

1. **`outbound-fetch-tunnel`** — **SHIPPED but test-blocked**.  Code in
   `policies/outbound-fetch-tunnel.ts`; correctly re-implements
   ClientRequest+IncomingMessage over `globalThis.fetch` and includes
   the lazy-bootstrap-priming workaround for the
   `lazy-load-from-microtask` debt.  Test in
   `tests/js/policy-outbound-fetch-tunnel.js` is skipped — `buffer-write-jsab-stale`
   was the primary blocker (string→Buffer encoding didn't land in JS
   side); now resolved structurally via the `buffer-wasm-aliased` policy in
   minimalPolicies.  Remaining blocker is `sab-ab-body-read` (any use of edge's bundled
   fetch in production browser deployment would hit it).  Either bug
   unblocks the test.
2. **`outbound-via-relay`** — TODO.  Would implement `sock_connect` to
   route HTTP bytes through a user-hosted relay.  Real TCP semantics
   inside the wasm; HTTPS still impossible (TLS bytes can't survive
   the relay round-trip via fetch).  Adds infrastructure surface.

Both plug in as additional `Policy` exports — no framework changes
needed.

### Real OPFS persistence

User wants this last.  Replace the in-memory writable layer with
`FileSystemSyncAccessHandle` backed storage.  Needs an async pre-warm
phase for directory handles.

### worker_threads

Each worker = real Web Worker with shared memory.  Bridge `postMessage`
to our SAB transport.

### Memory hygiene

Buffers we `_malloc` are never `_free`'d.  Long-running apps OOM.  Need
FinalizationRegistry or explicit lifetime tracking.

### `Buffer.poolSize=0` for file scripts

Auto-prepend works for `-e` only.  Needs a deeper hook for `edge file.js`.
