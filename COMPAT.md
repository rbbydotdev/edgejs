# Node.js Built-in Module Compatibility

Living document tracking which Node.js built-in modules work across
edge.js's deployment surfaces, with a side-by-side reference against
other Node-compat runtimes. Goal: be honest about what works, what's
partial, what's stubbed, and what we don't intend to ship.

**Last updated**: 2026-05-30.

## edge.js's two surfaces

| Surface | What it is | How JS executes |
|---|---|---|
| **edgejs** (base) | The upstream Node-fork: `lib/`, `src/`, `deps/`, `napi/`. Builds to `edgejs.wasm` runnable in any WASI(X)-compliant host (wasmer-CLI lane today). Reuses Node's stdlib; the host is real-OS-shaped. | Real V8 inside wasm |
| **edgejs-web** (browser-target) | The browser distribution: `browser-target/`. Adds a JS-side host (napi-host, wasi-shim, policies) that runs the same wasm under a browser DedicatedWorker via JSPI. | User JS routes through host V8 via `napi_run_script` (F-6 lever) |

Both share the same lib/. Differences come from (a) what the host can
provide (real OS vs browser sandbox) and (b) which policies are active.
The columns below distinguish them because the same Node module can
work differently depending on which surface answers the syscalls.

## How to read this

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✓ | Fully supported — passes most/all Node test corpus, no known major gaps |
| ◐ | Partial — works for common cases; some APIs or edge cases missing or approximated |
| ⊘ | Stubbed — module is importable but key APIs throw / no-op |
| ✗ | Not implemented — import throws or returns empty |
| — | Not applicable / architectural impossibility in this runtime |
| ? | Unknown — needs verification |

**edge.js status reflects current `main` branch.** Verify via `tests/js/`
(green = supported), `browser-target/src/policies/*` (compensating
policies), and `browser-target/src/napi-host/unofficial.ts` `#!~debt`
markers (known gaps).

## Side-by-side compat

**Column notes**:
- **edgejs** (base) — most cells reflect "inherits Node's lib + C++ binding"; pure-JS modules are ✓ by default. Network, FS, and process behavior depend on the WASI(X) host. Cells marked `?(host)` mean "depends on host capability; not exhaustively tested in our CI."
- **edgejs-web** — the browser-target distribution; cells reflect current `main` per `tests/js/`, policies, and `#!~debt` markers.
- **StackBlitz** — no per-module matrix is published; cells reflect (a) categorical limits from their troubleshooting page, (b) known bugs from public GitHub issues, (c) ✓ for modules where real Node works and no carve-out / bug is documented. **Important**: StackBlitz user JS runs on the browser's V8, but they do NOT have V8's C++ API in their wasm (CEO Eric Simons, JS Party #178: "we don't have access to the V8 API in the browser, for security reasons... port them over in WebAssembly"). That puts a ceiling on `vm`, `v8`, and any other module that needs V8 internals — they share our limit, not Node's full surface.

## How we compare

**Closest in architectural shape**: Bun, Deno run real V8 from their own native binary — they have full V8 C++ API access. StackBlitz runs Node's C/C++ in wasm but **without V8 in the wasm** — they bridge V8 calls back to the browser's JS, same surface ceiling we have. Cloudflare Workers and Vercel Edge are intentionally minimal serverless shapes.

This matters for modules that need V8 internals:
- **edgejs / edgejs-web / StackBlitz**: all bounded by what V8 exposes to JS. `vm` break-on-sigint, `vm` timeout, real `vm.Context` isolation, `v8` heap APIs — none of us can do these without going to extreme lengths (iframes for context isolation, etc.).
- **Bun / Deno**: real C++ V8 access via their native binaries — they CAN do these.

We're not behind StackBlitz on V8-bounded features; we're roughly the same. Where we trail StackBlitz is FS/network because they shipped those modules first and we deferred them.

**Where we lead**:
- ESM in browser (real blob-URL trampoline, cycles, TLA, dynamic, source-phase) — most runtimes either inherit Node's impl or don't support it
- `v8.serialize` / `deserialize` byte-exact with Node's V8 wire format
- IPC structured-clone advanced mode (`child-process-via-executor`)

**Where we trail**:
- HTTP/sockets/dgram — universally supported in Bun/Deno; we have it deferred
- `worker_threads` — phase 1 only; full feature parity not yet
- OPFS-backed `fs` write — deferred
- `async_hooks` promise hooks — universally weak (we match the floor)

**Architectural can't-dos** (same as Bun/Deno except where noted):
- `cluster` (fd-passing not available in browser; **we match all serverless-shaped runtimes here**)
- `sea` (single-executable applications)
- `repl` (no terminal)
- `wasi` from user code (we're the runtime, not a guest)
- `sqlite` (no host binding)

## Methodology for filling in this table

Each cell should be verifiable. For edge.js:
- ✓ = at least one test in `tests/js/` exercises the module's main API surface and passes
- ◐ = some tests pass; documented `#!~debt` markers exist for remaining gaps
- ⊘ = import doesn't throw, but key APIs return immediately or throw
- ✗ = import throws or returns empty exports

For other runtimes, status comes from their published compat tables (sources below). We don't independently verify them.

## What's not in this table

- **Web APIs** (`fetch`, `Response`, `crypto.subtle`, `WebSocket`, `URL`, `TextEncoder`, etc.) — every runtime here supports these; tracking would just be a row of ✓s.
- **Globals** (`process`, `Buffer`, `console`, etc.) — covered by their corresponding module rows.
- **npm package compatibility** — orthogonal to module-by-module compat. Bun and StackBlitz install real npm packages; edge.js doesn't have a package install story today (architectural gap, but not module compat).

**edge.js (this repo)**:
- `tests/js/*` — green tests indicate working API surface
- `browser-target/src/policies/*.ts` — compensating implementations
- `#!~debt` markers across `browser-target/src/` — documented gaps
- `NOTES.md` — Active tech-debt catalog

## Updating this doc

- Status changes when a `#!~debt` marker is added/removed or a test lands
- StackBlitz column entries come from troubleshooting carve-outs + filed GitHub issues; default-assume ✓ for modules where real Node works and no carve-out / bug is documented
- Bun's per-module test-pass rates evolve; re-fetch quarterly
- Add new modules when Node adds them (e.g. `node:sqlite` shipped in 22.5)
- Surprises worth flagging:
  - Bun's `http` has NO percentage — only a caveat about outgoing client body buffering
  - Bun's `http2` 95% is from gRPC's suite, not Node's (apples-to-oranges)
  - StackBlitz hides known broken algos behind GitHub issues — no advisory in the troubleshooting doc
